# About Me

I am a **postgraduate student in Urban Spatial Science** at The Bartlett, UCL, with a background in architecture and urbanism. My academic and professional journey has allowed me to develop expertise in geospatial analysis and urban planning applied to different topics like mobility, housing planning, and urban policy.\
