The results of the clustering analysis also serve as a valuable tool for guiding localized strategies and policies, ensuring they are tailored to the distinct socio-economic and spatial contexts of each cluster. In general, the findings emphasize that fire risk is a multidimensional issue, requiring mitigation strategies that extend beyond fire safety measures to address underlying socio-econ",

Amid threats of relocation and the loss of territorial identity, the model aims to preserve the essence of Bajo Belen while avoiding current issues such as disconnection, overcrowding, and vulnerability to flooding. The proposal consists of a two-scale intervention: first, a master plan with three key intervention areas—connector, mitigator, and landscape borders—and transversal axes to integrate them; second, an urban and architectural design framework for elements like commerce, roads, housing, communal spaces, docks, and pools, tailored to local techniques, climate, and culture. This intervention demonstrates the potential for a new way of inhabiting the river, preserving social, economic, and environmental connections while ensuring a safe and dignified future for the community.",
