The proposal consists of a two-scale intervention: first, a master plan with three key intervention areas—connector, mitigator, and landscape borders—and transversal axes to integrate them; second, an urban and architectural design framework for elements like commerce, roads, housing, communal spaces, docks, and pools, tailored to local techniques, climate, and culture.
